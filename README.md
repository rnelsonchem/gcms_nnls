# GCMS AIA File Import and Non-negative Least squares

**NOTE** These programs are deprecated. Use
[gcmstools]((https://github.com/rnelsonchem/gcmstools) instead.

These programs serve two roles: 1) to provide a class to read standard GCMS
AIA data files, and 2) to fit the data using non-negative least squares with a
series of reference spectra. 

These programs require Python 2.7 and the following libraries: 
* Numpy (v 1.9.1 tested)
* Matplotlib (v 1.4.2 tested)
* netCDF4 (v 1.0.4 tested)
* PyTables (v 3.1.1 tested)
* Scipy (v 0.14.0 tested) 

The usage of these programs is outlined in the [online user
guide](http://rnelsonchem.github.io/gcms_nnls/), which is also [available
as a
pdf](https://github.com/rnelsonchem/gcms_nnls/blob/master/gcmstools.pdf?raw=true).
